			Google Cast is a technology that allows Android and iOS mobile apps and Chrome web apps to 	"cast" content - like video, audio, and screen sharing (mirroring) - to Cast-ready devices like Google Chromecast.

			In the Cast user model, the mobile device or laptop is the sender which controls the playback, and the TV is the receiver which displays the content. All the user interaction and most of the user interface takes place on the sender device rather than on the TV.

			Casting relies on the coordination between two or more screens; the sender UI and the receiver UI must work together. For example, if content is paused, the TV should indicate that it is paused, while the mobile device should provide the action to resume playback (i.e. with a Play button).
